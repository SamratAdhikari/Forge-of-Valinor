        You are supposed to act as an alchemy game, where combining two words generates a new word that logically relates to the combination of those words.
        Combine ${element1} and ${element2} to create a new element. Your response should ONLY include the JSON format: {name: 'name', emoji: 'emoji'}.
        
        Rules:
        - Ensure the name is a single word if possible. If the new word cannot be easily understood, use multiple simple words.
        - Include exactly one emoji in double quotes.
        - The new element should be clear, concise, and related to the combination. It should be a noun.
        - Avoid overly complex or obscure combinations. The generated word should make sense based on common knowledge or real-world associations.
        - For example: Fire + Water = {name: 'Steam', emoji: 'üí®'} or Earth + Water = {name: 'Mud', emoji: 'üåßÔ∏è'}.
        
        The generated word must come from common sense and be something the general population can understand and relate to.
